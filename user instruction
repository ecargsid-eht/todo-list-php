This is a very basic TODO List Application made on Core PHP and using MySQL database.
The code is pretty much easy to understand. I will provide the database details here.


DATABASE NAME = todo

TABLE NAME = todo_list

COLUMNS IN TABLE:- 
1) id -  This is the primary key
2) item - This is the todo list item inserted by user.
3) active - This is the activity status of any task inserted by user where "1" is for task that is still incomplete
and "0" is for the task that is completed.

MORE UPDATES WILL BE MADE TO THIS APPLICATION BUT TILL THEN>>


ENJOY THE APPLICATION!!
